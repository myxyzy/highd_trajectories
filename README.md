# highd_trajectories
This is code for plotting trajectories for the [HighD data set of highway traffic](https://www.highd-dataset.com/). The reading builds on code by [RobertKrajewski](https://github.com/RobertKrajewski/highD-dataset/)

To run it you need to have the data in a directory called data (and keep the names from the original data set). You also need to make a parallel directory `fig` for the output figures. Then just run it as

`python3 highd_trajectories.py`
